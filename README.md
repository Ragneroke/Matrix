# Matrix
Here is one of the assignment from the class cs101 in University of California, Santa Cruz.
In List.java, I modified a node-based doubly linked list with a cursor, which allowed user to pop
, insert or read a specific position in the linked list.
In Matrix.java, it create a matrix which each row is a doubly linked list.
